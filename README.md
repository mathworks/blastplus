# What is BLAST+?
Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) finds regions of local similarity between biological sequences, in order to infer evolutionary relationships and identify members of gene families. While BLAST searches can be [performed on the web](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi), [BLAST+](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/doc/blast-help/downloadblastdata.html) enables users to perform BLAST searches on their own machines by creating databases and executing queries locally.
